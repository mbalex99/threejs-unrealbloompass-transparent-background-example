I made this because I wanted to experiment with ThreeJS. ThreeJS has a massive API and TypeScript is pretty critical for a nice auto-complete experience in an IDE like VSCode. __I also wanted live-reloading for fast iteration__. 

Getting Started:

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
4. Open up your browser to `localhost:9000`

Just get started with editing your typescript code in: `./src/index.ts`

## Commentary

* This uses `ts-loader`, `webpack`
* See `webpack.config.js` for configuration
